## Technical Details

### Performance Targets
- **Response Time**: < 100ms for cached queries, < 500ms for complex matches
- **Memory Usage**: < 50MB steady state
- **Concurrent Users**: 1000+ simultaneous sessions
- **CPU Usage**: < 10% under normal load

### Pattern Matching
Uses fuzzy string matching with Levenshtein distance algorithm to understand user intent even with typos or variations in phrasing.

### Response Strategy
- Multiple response variations per category (3+ options)

- Context-aware based on user role and current app route
- Graceful fallback for unrecognized queries
